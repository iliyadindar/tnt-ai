    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how our Speech to Text application collects, uses, and shares your information.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Microphone Data</h3>
    <p>Our application requests access to your device's microphone (RECORD_AUDIO permission). This access is strictly used to record your speech for the purpose of converting it into text.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The audio data recorded is sent to our processing server primarily to perform the transcription. We do not store your audio data permanently, and we do not use it for any other purpose such as advertising or training public models without your explicit consent.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Audio files are processed in real-time or near real-time and are deleted from our servers shortly after transcription is complete.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
